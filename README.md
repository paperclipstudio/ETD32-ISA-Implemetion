# Emulator for ETD32 ISA 
This project is a implentaion of ETD32 ISA currently tageting v0.1.0 which is
being created by Camden Dixie Oâ€™Brien

# ETD32 ISA 
Is self described as:
A little-endian, 32-bit RISC architecture, designed to be simple
and relatively easy to implement. It is primarily intended for educational use, such
as teaching processor internals and design, assembly language programming and
compiler development.

# Project Struture
## Emulator
An emulations of a ISA compliant CPU

## Test board (This my become integrated into emulator
A system for feeding the emulator with instutions and reading output.

## Compiler
A simple compiler from assembly to machine code. 

## Sample Code
Holds a couple of sample programs in both machine and assembly.

## Tests
This project is going to be done in a TDD style as we have target specification 
to fit, and correctness is easy to test for this project.
